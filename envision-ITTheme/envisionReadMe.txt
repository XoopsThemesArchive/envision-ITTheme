There are a few non-standard Xoops items built within this styloe.

1. In the center text body section (System-->Admin--> Blocks) the Center Left and Center Right blocks appear at the top of each delivered webpage (forced by  theme design).  This allows dual columns to appear at the top of your web page; the single Main block will follow below all Center Left and Center Right Blocks.
2. The Left Side Menu appears on the Right Side of the webpage (Menu) below the Right Menu. (A combined Menu Bar).
3. The site is set to display at a width of 1000 pixels.
